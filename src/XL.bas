''========================================================================
'' Description
'' "getUserCLs" exposes all initialized CLs stored in "userCLs" variable
'' If "userCLs" is not initialized then "getUserCLs" (most likely called
''  from a UDF) deffers the call to "initCLsCallback which in turn
''  initializes the CLs and refreshes all formulas in order to forcefully
''  calculate non-volatile UDFs
